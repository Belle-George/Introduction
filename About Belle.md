🖖 Welcome aboard! I’m Belle — a Star Trek enthusiast and  Business Intelligence Analyst navigating the final frontier of data. Recently certified and fully equipped with Tableau, Excel, SQL, and a tricorder full of curiosity.

I specialize in transforming raw data into clean dashboards and strategic insight — think of it as translating Klingon into plain English for business stakeholders. With 5 years of experience in client engagement, systems analysis, and problem-solving (and 2 years of teaching humans how to learn), I bring logic, creativity, and a touch of warp speed to every project.

🖥️ Building dashboards that would impress even Spock.  
🌿 On a long-term mission toward a family homestead.  
🧭 Explorer at heart — of both Earth’s trails and data’s secrets.  
🎯 Currently open to project collaborations and outsourcing ops — resistance to meaningful data is futile.
